🏡 House Price Prediction Model
📘 Overview

The House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project built using Python to predict property prices based on various housing features.
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end data science workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

🚀 Features

Loads and explores a real-world housing dataset

Cleans missing and duplicate data

Detects and removes outliers using the IQR method

Performs data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Trains and compares multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluates models using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is housing.csv.zip, which includes information such as:

Average area income

Average area house age

Average number of rooms

Average number of bedrooms

Area population

House price

🧠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation metrics

⚙️ Workflow

Import Dependencies

Load essential Python libraries for analysis and modeling.

Load Dataset

Import housing.csv.zip using Pandas.

Data Exploration

View dataset info, summary statistics, and visualizations.

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, duplicates, and detect outliers.

Outlier Removal

Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove extreme data points.

Model Training

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train models using different regression algorithms.

Model Evaluation

Evaluate each model using MSE, MAE, and R² score.

Compare performance across all models.
